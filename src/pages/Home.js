        When creating or updating a website, think about the end user and what
        problem of theirs you're solving with your product or service. One of
        the most crucial website functionalities is user experience. You want
        your website to drive action, create a positive emotional response, and
        be useful. Websites need to be easy to use and have an intuitive design.
        You'll likely lose sales to a competitor if your website causes
        frustration, with hard-to-find content or a complicated checkout
        process. People are busy and often multi-task; your website needs to
        quickly give them the information they want. Content needs to have a
        natural flow and be intuitive. If a customer goes to your website to
        reach customer service, think about the actions you want them to take.
        You can first solve quick questions with a FAQ page and include contact
        information at the bottom if they still need help. What action do you
        want them to take afterward? You could direct them to your blog or a
        helpful product tips article.
